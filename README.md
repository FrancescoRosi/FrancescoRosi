hi, I'm Francesco. I'm from Italy, go by any pronouns, and make some great software. hopefully.

my best work at the moment is:
- [Zappr](https://zappr.stream) - web app for watching Italian free-to-air television
  - that sounds boring and generic but I swear it's good

- [my personal website](https://francescoro.si) - "portfolio" website made with vanilla HTML, CSS and JS
  - that doesn't mean it doesn't look good though!
